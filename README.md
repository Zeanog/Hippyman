This is a work in progress.  Simple Pacman clone using funny models.  I also implemented A* to refresh my memory.

I'm slowly adding gameplay features

All models and animations are from Mixamo.com

The idea is you play a hippy and your boss, the mayor, and other authority figures chase you.  The large pellets are 'Evidence of Corruption' and when the authority figures get caught they turn into handcuffs and go to jail.  All the small pellets add up to $10.  :P

I am working on pathing currently.
